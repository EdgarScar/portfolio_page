I grew up with hourly quotas of dial-up internet, school PowerPoints saved on floppy disks and the PC game The Adventures of Captain Comic. As time went on, my love for technology and my savviness with computers only increased. I enjoy multiplayer gaming, especially couch gaming and LAN parties. Whatâ€™s more, I have always been to the go-to guy in my family for any tech-related questions, and I have learned to impart knowledge without judgement or impatience.",
